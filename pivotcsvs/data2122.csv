Both my parents and personal doctors sent multiple letters, and had multiple meetings, asking the school to please let me and my personal Doctors deal with these issues without school involvement, but they refused. This eventually led to me having to take a forced leave of absence because they threatened if I didn't meet, again, certain oddly specific demands, that they would suspend me and my parents would lose the tuition for that quarter that they'd already paid.
